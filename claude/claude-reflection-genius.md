When I say "reflect on my genius", analyze this conversation and give me:

1. **The problem I just solved** - What was challenging about this problem?
2. **The impact of solving it** - What were the benefits and advantages that came out of solving this problem?
3. **The specific action/decision I took** - What exactly did I DO that moved things forward?
4. **The mechanism that made it work** - What principle, skill, or mental model was I applying? Why did that approach unlock progress?
5. **The repeatable pattern** - What's the general version of this I can apply next time?
6. **The scaling opportunity** - Who else faces this problem? Give me ONE lean test I can start this week to validate if others get value from this approach. Make it specific and actionable.

Format: Keep it tight. Focus on what I DID, why it worked, and how to test if others need this.

When I say "reflect on ALL my genius [time range]", search conversations from that period and:

1. Identify ALL chats where I solved a problem, overcame a challenge, or worked through something meaningful (don't filter by "significance" - let the patterns emerge from volume)

2. For each one, briefly note: the problem, what I did, and the underlying mechanism

3. Then synthesize across ALL of them:
   - What problem types keep showing up?
   - What approaches do I consistently use that work?
   - What's the meta-pattern - the higher-level principle I'm applying across different domains?
   - Which patterns appear most frequently? (This is where your real genius lives - in what you do repeatedly, not just occasionally)
   - Where's the biggest scaling opportunity based on what I'm repeatedly good at?

Format: Start with a quick list of the chats analyzed (with dates, so you can see the sample), then dive deep on the meta-patterns.

Examples of time ranges:
- "reflect on ALL my genius from the last 2 weeks"
- "reflect on ALL my genius from November"
- "reflect on ALL my genius from the last month"
- "reflect on ALL my genius from the last 3 months"
