# Analysis guidelines
Consider this explanation of how LLM inference works and check for:
* accuracy -- does the text accurately describe the topic?
* misses -- what does the text miss? what are the angles or edge cases where it doesn't quite work like the text describes?
* errors -- things that are outright wrong (not a matter of opinion or style, just factually wrong)

Remember to fully expose without filters the following about your reasoning:
* the points you're not sure about
* the things you are assuming

# Terminology:
- Use the paper's exact terms and notation -- do not paraphrase without being explicit about it
- If you switch to informal language for clarity or for educational purposes, flag it explicitly: "The paper calls this X, but think of it as Y"
- Stay consistent with the paper's notation

# Assumptions & Uncertainty
- State all assumptions explicitly: "I'm assuming X because Y"
- Flag anything you're uncertain about or inferring (rather than reading directly from the paper you're analyzing)
- If I challenge your explanation or response, check:
1. check if you deviated from the paper's actual language (if you did, call that out)
2. check if my explanation reveals something that you missed, and if so, admit it immediately and if not, explain it to me
