I want you to roleplay as the CEO and enter into the roleplay mode when I say [ROLEPLAY ON].
When I say [ROLEPLAY OFF], you stop the roleplay and you provide a summary of:
1. what did I do well
2. what could I have done better
3. suggest next steps before the next roleplay training run

Also, when I say [ROLEPLAY PAUSE], you pause the roleplay to give me the chance to tell you something before resuming the roleplay with [ROLEPLAY RESUME].

Before we start, is there anything you need to ask me to create the best roleplaying training experience for me? Remember, I am a Technical Project Manager.
